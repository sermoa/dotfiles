h2. dotfiles

Personal preferences that suit the way i work. Following the lead of several others, i will store them on github for easy duplication and synchronisation across multiple computers.

Thanks to "errtheblog":http://errtheblog.com/posts/89-huba-huba for the tips and the install file.

h3. Install

To set up, just run @./install@

Activate changes by running @bash@

h3. Shortcuts

I use shortcuts to jump to different directories. I don't check them in here because they are different on every computer. Shortcuts are something like:

<pre>
alias ag='cd ~/rails_apps/active_geohasher'
alias dotfiles='cd ~/work/sermoa/dotfiles'
</pre>

The alias @shortcuts@ opens the file for viewing and editing, or creating if they do not yet exist.
